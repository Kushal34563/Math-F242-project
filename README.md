Here in this project, we explore the side of machine learning that can be used to estimate or
predict when people stand in queues while availing of different kinds of services.
We proceeded with the project by trying to find publicly available datasets. The dataset we used
was a public dataset of queues in banks in Nigeria. It includes data from 2 different banks,
spanning five days a week for four weeks. We analyzed and processed the data to make it suitable
for machine learning. Then we moved by training a neural network using SciKit machine
learning. Unfortunately, the dataset did not have the required stats about the deployed servers,
so it wasnâ€™t possible to build a direct connection against queuing theory. However, we still, 
managed to improve. We reached a mean absolute error of around 3.6 minutes, which is better
when compared to the models' performances based on past analysis of variables
such as sales, earnings, etc.
After using a bank scenario for predicting the waiting time, we can use this example to
extrapolate the waiting time in other industries. We can generalize the queuing time so that we
can accommodate more industries. Queueing theory is helpful to get an idea about the waiting
time of a client, reduce staff workload, and much more.
